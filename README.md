# NYC_Yellow_taxi_cabs

Performed exploratory data analysis on New York City yellow taxicab dataset to predict the trip duration using Deep Learning Models such as Multi-Layer Perceptron, TensorFlow/Keras Sequential Model, and Deep Neural Network. 

Uploaded data from an open-source website, explored pick-up and drop-off locations, numbers of customers, and trip duration between models, and found the most efficient features that help accurately predict trip duration.

Added a weather data set and concluded that weather is a factor impacting the trip duration.

Compared Deep Learning Models to identify Deep Neural Network as the optimal model for prediction with best accuracy
